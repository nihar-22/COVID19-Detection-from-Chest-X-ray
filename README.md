## General info
The new coronavirus(COVID-19), which has been proclaimed as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, has infected over 180 million individuals and killed over 4  million. The detection of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images has life-saving significance for both patients and doctors. I've developed a project for automatically detecting COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images using transfer learning.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.6
* Matplot liblibrary version: 3.4.2
* TenserFlow library version: 2.5.0
* scikit-learn library version: 0.24.2
* VGG16 model version: 2.5.0

## How to use
Simply open the ipynb file and run this all cell to train the model.
I am also including trained model. You can also get it trained in moderate time.
you can use last code cell to predict whether the chest X-ray image is covid infected or not.
